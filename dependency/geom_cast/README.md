Clean conversion between different point and rotation types used throughout ROS.
Conversion is type-safe and has NO performance penalty relative to manual conversion.
Supports Eigen, tf, pcl, geometry_msgs and OpenCV points.

# TODO

- More types: std::vector, KDL, std::array
- Types with timestamps?
- Extensibility?
- Anything new for tf2?
